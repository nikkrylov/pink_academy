1. Alt attribute for all images
2. Make hint to press Ctrl button in map section (like best students did).
3. Make backgrounds with color close to background images.
4. How to make button for slider to make page semantic and available. In my previous projects (nerds, device) it is realised via inputs. Without CSS it makes these inputs unusable.
